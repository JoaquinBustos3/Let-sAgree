      question: "What is Let's Agree?",
      answer: "Let's Agree is a platform designed to help people come to agreements on contentious everyday decisions by providing options based on your preferences and finding matches that both parties will enjoy."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the matching process work?",
      answer: "After you and your partner/friend select a category, you'll input your preferences for results you'd like to see. Our algorithm will then generate options and let you both swipe on what you like. With your matches, you can make a decision you both agree on or continue onto another round of swiping!"
    },
    {
      question: "Which way do I swipe?",
      answer: "Swiping left indicates a dislike, while swiping right indicates a like. Swiping up simply navigates to the next card without indicating a like or dislike, while swiping down navigates to the previous card."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the recommendations?",
      answer: "Our recommendations are generated based on the preferences you provide. The more specific you are, the better the matches will be."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Let's Agree free to use?",
      answer: "Yes! Let's Agree is currently in beta and free for all users."
    },
    {
      question: "What's to come?",
      answer: "In the future, you can expect the capability to synchronously swipe with your peer, specify any category, include more than 2 people, save sets of generated results, and more!"
